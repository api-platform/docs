This allows flexible and automatic management of both the security of the API (access control for resources, automatic filters, etc.) but also the security of the client (in <strong>Vue.js</strong>), to control the UI and its functionalities according to the current user's rights, transparent hot reload of permissions included in case of modifications!</p>","type":"conference","speakers":"-marion","track":"FR","start":"14:45","end":"15:25","date":"2021-09-10","short":"Discover Marion's implementation to operate advanced permissions","title":"Unified permission management between API and client","edition":2021}},"staticQueryHashes":["2760183193","3395815452"]}
