Since then, I've contributed to more then 200 commits and in the last years I've maintained the repository alongside Kevin Dunglas. Today we're working on the next major release, API Platform 3 and it is quite a journey.</p>\n<p>From fixing bugs to bringing simplicity by following the Symfony's backward compatibility promise, <strong>I'll explain how we planed and built this new version</strong>. I'll explain our thought process, the issues we encountered, errors we made, and how we attempted to organise everything to bring you a clean and pleasant upgrade process! On top of this, we'll cover every new feature you need to be aware of!</p>","type":"conference","speakers":"-antoine","track":"EN","start":"09:55","end":"10:35","date":"2021-09-10","short":"Go behind the scenes of API Platform' new release.","title":"The journey towards API Platform 3","edition":2021}},"staticQueryHashes":["2760183193","3395815452"]}
