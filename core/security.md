# Security

To completely disable some operations from your application, refer to the [disabling operations](operations.md#enabling-and-disabling-operations)
section.

Using API Platform, you can leverage all security features provided by the [Symfony Security component](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/security.html).
For instance, if you wish to restrict the access of some endpoints, you can use [access controls directives](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/security.html#securing-url-patterns-access-control).

It is also possible to use the [event system](events.md) for more advanced logic or even [custom actions](operations.md#creating-custom-operations-and-controllers)
if you really need to.
