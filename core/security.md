# Security

API Platform provides advanced authentication and authorization features to secure your API.

When using API Platform for Symfony, API Platform leverages the [Symfony Security component](https://symfony.com/doc/current/security.html)
to help you secure your API.

When using API Platform for Laravel, it provides an integration with popular authentication packages for Laravel, and
with the built-in authorization features of the framework.
