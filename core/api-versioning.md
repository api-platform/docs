# About API versioning

API Platform does not provide any specific tooling for API versioning.

The recommended way to do API versioning is to create a separate project.

The subject has notably been discussed [here](https://github.com/api-platform/core/issues/45) and [here](https://github.com/api-platform/core/issues/972).
