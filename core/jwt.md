# JWT Authentication

> [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io/) is a JSON-based open standard ([RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)) for creating access tokens that assert
> some number of claims. For example, a server could generate a token that has the claim "logged in as admin" and
> provide that to a client. The client could then use that token to prove that he/she is logged in as admin.
> The tokens are signed by the server's key, so the server is able to verify that the token is legitimate. The tokens
> are designed to be compact, URL-safe and usable especially in web browser single sign-on (SSO) context.
