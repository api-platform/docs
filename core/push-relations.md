# Pushing Related Resources Using HTTP/2

> HTTP/2 allows a server to pre-emptively send (or "push") responses (along with corresponding "promised" requests) to a client in association with a previous client-initiated request. This can be useful when the server knows the client will need to have those responses available in order to fully process the response to the original request.

API Platform leverages this capability by pushing relations of a resource to clients.

**Note:** We strongly recommend using [Vulcain](https://vulcain.rocks) instead of this feature.
Vulcain is faster, cleaner, more flexible, and is supported out of the box in the API Platform distribution.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Entity;

use ApiPlatform\Core\Annotation\ApiProperty;
use ApiPlatform\Core\Annotation\ApiResource;

/**
 * @ApiResource
 */
class Book
{
    /**
     * @var Author
     * @ApiProperty(push=true)
     */
    public $author;
    
    // ...
}
```

By setting the `push` attribute to `true` on a property holding a relation, API Platform will automatically add a valid `Link` HTTP header with the `preload` relation.
According to the [Preload W3C Candidate Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/preload/), web servers and proxy servers can read this header, fetch the related resource and send it to the client using Server Push.
[NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-1-13-9-http2-server-push/), [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/http2.html#push), [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/website-optimization/http2/serverpush/), [Fastly](https://docs.fastly.com/guides/performance-tuning/http2-server-push) and [Akamai](https://blogs.akamai.com/2017/03/http2-server-push-the-what-how-and-why.html) honor this header. 

Using this feature maximises HTTP cache hits for your API resources.
For best performance, this feature should be used in conjunction with [the built-in HTTP cache invalidation system (based on Varnish)](performance.md#enabling-the-built-in-http-cache-invalidation-system).
