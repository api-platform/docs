# Extending API Platform

Because it handles the complex, tedious and repetitive task of creating an API infrastructure for you, API Platform lets you focus on what matter the most for the end user: the business logic.
To do so, API Platform provides a lot of extension points you can use to hook your own code.
Those extensions points are taken into account both by the REST and [GraphQL](graphql.md) subsystems.

The following tables summarizes which extension point to use depending on what you want to do:

| Extension Point                                                                                | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Leveraging the Built-in Infrastructure Using Composition 

While most API Platform classes are marked as `final`, built-in services are straightforward to reuse and customize [using composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance).

For instance, if you want to send a mail after a resource has been persisted, but still want to benefit from the native Doctrine ORM [data persister](data-persisters.md), use [the decorator design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern#PHP) to wrap the native data persister in your own class sending the mail, as demonstrated in [this example](data-persisters.md#decorating-the-built-in-data-persisters).

To replace existing API Platform services with your decorators, [check out how to decorate services](https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container/service_decoration.html).
