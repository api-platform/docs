# GraphQL Support

## Overall View

[GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) is a query language made to communicate with an API and therefore is an alternative to REST.

It has some advantages compared to REST: it solves the over-fetching or under-fetching of data, is strongly typed, and is capable of retrieving multiple and nested data in one time; but it also comes with drawbacks: for example it creates overhead depending of the request.

API Platform creates a REST API by default. But you can choose to enable GraphQL as well.

Once enabled, you have nothing to do: your schema describing your API is automatically built and your GraphQL endpoint is ready to go!

## Enabling GraphQL

To enable GraphQL and GraphiQL interface in your API, simply require the graphql-php package using Composer:

    $ composer require webonyx/graphql-php

You can now use GraphQL at the endpoint: `http://localhost/graphql`.

## GraphiQL

If Twig is installed in your project, go to the GraphQL endpoint with your browser. You will see a nice interface provided by GraphiQL to interact with your API.

If you need to disable it, it can be done in the configuration:

```yaml
# app/config/config.yml
api_platform:
    graphql:
        graphiql:
            enabled: false
# ...            
```
