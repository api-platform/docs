# The API Platform Admin

API Platform Admin is a tool to automatically create a fancy (Material Design) and fully featured administration interface
for any API supporting [the Hydra Core Vocabulary](http://www.hydra-cg.com/), including but not limited to all APIs created
using [the API Platform framework](https://api-platform.com).

The generated administration is a 100% standalone Single-Page-Application with no coupling to the server part, according
to the API-first paradigm.

API Platform Admin parses the Hydra documentation then uses the awesome [React Admin](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/)
library (and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)) to expose a nice, responsive, management interface (Create-Retrieve-Update-Delete)
for all available resources.

You can also customize all screens by using React Admin components and even raw JavaScript/React code.

## Features

* Automatically generate an admin interface for all the resources of the API thanks to hypermedia features of Hydra
* Generate list, create, show, edit screens as well as a delete button
* Generate suitable inputs and fields according to the API doc (e.g. number HTML input for numbers, checkbox for booleans, selectbox for relationships...)
* Generate suitable inputs and fields according to Schema.org types if available (e.g. email field for http://schema.org/email)
* Handle relationships
* Pagination support
* Automatically validate if a field is mandatory client-side according to the API description
* Send proper HTTP requests to the API and decode them using Hydra and JSON-LD formats
* Nicely display server-side errors (e.g. advanced validation)
* **100% customizable**
